# chem_calculator
Originally in high school chemistry I got bored of doing all of the calculations by hand with a calculator. So I created a Google Spreadsheet with many different 'calculators', as I put them, to do these tedious calculations for me. Now, though, I am learning Python and I want a way to apply that so I remember what I learn. This is a collection of the same calculators in my spreadsheet turned into Python programs.
